# Transatomic Reactor Documentation

Welcome to the main repository for Transatomic's public domain reactor design documents. We're very glad to be working with the Department of Energy's Gateway for Accelerated Innovation in Nuclear to share our design with the public, and we hope that this work will support a wide range of molten salt reactor research and development efforts. 

For additional information, and if you'd like to contribute to this project, please contact [info@transatomicpower.com](mailto:info@transatomicpower.com).
